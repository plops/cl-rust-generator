* Goal

Common Lisp package that converts S-expressions to source code of the Rust programming language.


* Examples

** 01_gcd

from book, minimal

** 02_webgcd

from book

** 03_glium

opengl binding. apparantly, original developer seems to have abandoned
the approach in 2016. people still seem to use it. i just want to just
get up and running with an immediate mode gui. this looks too
cumbersome.

** 04_azul

perhaps this is easier to use for a 2d gui


* Emacs config

for viewing the generated code

- Install rust-mode and eglot with Melpa
- rustup component add rls --toolchain stable-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
